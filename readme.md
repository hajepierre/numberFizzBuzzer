# FizzBuzz with a Pink Flamingo

The task was programmed using java. 

## IDEs

The code was attempted first using Netbeans but when unit tests failed I moved the code to eclipse. This is the reason why I have another branch I called eclipse. It is the one hosting the code with tests and it is the code I am submitting. But I will merge eclipse and master branch at the last.
